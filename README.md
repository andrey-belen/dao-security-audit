# The DAO Security Audit

A comprehensive security analysis and recreation of the infamous 2016 DAO hack that resulted in the theft of 3.6M ETH ($60M USD) and led to the Ethereum hard fork.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This repository demonstrates elite blockchain security expertise through the professional recreation and analysis of one of DeFi's most significant security incidents. The project includes:

- **Vulnerable DAO Contract**: Faithful reproduction of the 2016 DAO vulnerability
- **Attack Implementation**: Complete reentrancy exploit with detailed analysis
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Professional-grade test suite with attack simulations
- **Security Documentation**: Enterprise-level incident analysis and findings

## 🔍 Vulnerability Analysis

### The 2016 DAO Reentrancy Attack

**Impact**: $60M USD stolen, 3.6M ETH drained, Ethereum hard fork
**Root Cause**: External call before state update in withdrawal function
**Attack Vector**: Recursive calling through fallback function

### Technical Details

```solidity
// VULNERABLE PATTERN
function withdraw(uint256 amount) external {
    require(balances[msg.sender] >= amount);
    
    // VULNERABILITY: External call before state update
    msg.sender.call{value: amount}("");
    
    // State update happens AFTER external call
    balances[msg.sender] -= amount;
}
```

The attacker exploits the gap between the external call and state update to recursively drain the contract.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- [Foundry](https://getfoundry.sh/) installed
- Basic understanding of Solidity and smart contract security

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dao-security-audit
cd dao-security-audit
forge install
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all security tests
forge test -vv

# Run specific attack demonstration
forge test --match-test test_ReentrancyAttackDemonstration -vv

# Run with maximum verbosity for detailed trace
forge test --match-test test_ReentrancyAttackDemonstration -vvvv
```

### Build Contracts

```bash
forge build
```

## 📊 Test Results

The test suite demonstrates:

- **Normal Operations**: DAO functions correctly under legitimate use
- **Attack Simulation**: Complete reentrancy exploit with 1000% ROI
- **Edge Cases**: Various attack scenarios and defensive patterns
- **Invariant Testing**: Property-based testing for financial consistency

### Attack Demonstration Output

```
=== REENTRANCY ATTACK DEMONSTRATION ===
DAO Balance Before Attack: 9000000000000000000 (9 ETH)
Attacker Balance Before Attack: 2000000000000000000 (2 ETH)

--- Attack Results ---
DAO Balance After Attack: 0 (0 ETH)
Attacker Balance After Attack: 11000000000000000000 (11 ETH)
Total Amount Stolen: 10000000000000000000 (10 ETH)
Attack ROI: 1000%
