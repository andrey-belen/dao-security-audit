# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a DAO security audit repository. The directory is currently empty and ready for security analysis work.

## Development Commands

*Commands will be added as the project structure is established*

## Architecture

*Architecture details will be documented as the codebase is developed*

## Security Focus

This repository is specifically for defensive security analysis of DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) systems. All work should focus on:

- Identifying potential vulnerabilities
- Creating security analysis reports
- Developing detection rules and defensive tools
- Documenting security best practices
- Performing code audits and reviews

## Notes for Future Development

- This is a security-focused repository - only defensive security tasks should be performed
- When analyzing smart contracts or DAO code, pay special attention to:
  - Access control mechanisms
  - Token handling and transfers
  - Governance voting mechanisms
  - Time-based operations and delays
  - External dependencies and oracle usage
  - Reentrancy protection
  - Integer overflow/underflow protection
